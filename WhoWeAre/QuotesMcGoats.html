          <p>I like robotics because it breaks down the walls of the classroom and exposes us to the real world; the world where deadlines loom and problems arise that require addressing. Throughout the season the team must evolve and adapt. 
          	<br> –AJ Kalkowski<br>

I’ve really enjoyed robotics this year, particularly being able to work hands-on with the manipulator group.  I have learned so much this year about tools, my team, and my abilities.  This was a great opportunity and I’m glad I was able to be a part of it my last year here at IMSA.
<br>-Ashley Lane<br>
<br>
Troubleshooting the program is the hardest part of building a working robot.<br>
–Sara Akgul<br>
<br>
I think efficiency and communication were issues from last year that we wanted to improve on, and I like how the team has more organization and better communication this year than we have had in the past.
<br>–Renny O’Connor<br>
<br>
Watching something you built with your own hands come alive is one of the best feelings in the world – FIRST Robotics provides highschoolers with the opportunity to experience it. 
<br>–Alina Kononov<br>
<br>
The IMSA Robotics team has become a large part of my senior year. It’s been great being a part of the team, because I’ve learned so much about tools, what it takes to build something so great, and even more about my friends. I live with this team, but working together on this robot has made us even closer, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.

Sometimes you're in the robotics room, working, and there's a horrible
cracking noise. Nine times out of ten, though, it's just a guy breaking
their fiftieth bit of the day. No worries. It's almost never a finger.<br>
–Emily Weiland<br>
<br>
If it involves motors and grease, count me in. <br>
–Brian Page<br>
<br>
I have enjoyed leading robotics for the
past 3 years.  I'm really excited to be going to the Midwest and
the Milwaukee regionals.  Put me in any subteam of robotics, and I'll make
it work. <br>
–Caitlin Bunt<br>
<br>
I really like using the Drill Press and learning how to program in C++. <br>
–Shawon Jackson<br>
<br>
Robotics has paved the way to my future in aerospace engineering <br>
–Ricardo Gonzales<br>
<br>
Flip it over and attack its weak point for maximum damage <br>
–Alex Goins<br>
<br>
I am legend; The legendary driver, inquirer and leader. <br>
–Scott Page<br>
<br>
Never jinx the CNC machine or something will break. <br>
– Chris Wallace<br>
<br>
Robotics has been one of the best experiences of my life. I really enjoyed working on the manipulator both years…yes that means I enjoy playing with balls. <br>
– Cameron Breedlove<br>
<br>
If all else fails we made a maximum proportion box that will hopefully become a moving wall. Moving is better than not moving. <br>

       My first year, and what an interesting one. Oh well, Back to coding now...<br>

I’ve been in robotics for three years, and I really love it. I take care of the electronics and im one of the system integrators <br>
–Ruhiyyeh Turner<br>
<br>
I am a sophomore and this is my first year in robotics. I help out with the robot by doing various jobs that need to be done.  I have really enjoyed robotics this year and plan to come back next year to help out with the next FIRST competition.  
<br>–Monika Kozibal<br>
<br>
It’s only my first year, in robotics, but I really enjoy it.  Nothing else compares.  It’s a great competition, and a great team.  Even if my Gravity Gun idea was shot down.  <br>
