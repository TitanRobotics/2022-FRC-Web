          <p>
          	Six years ago, Jim Gerry was approached by three students with an intriguing question: could Robotics be brought into the western Chicago suburbs? Jim reached out to local businesses before securing support from Caterpillar. Ever forward thinking, Jim not only built the interest and economic framework for Titan Robotics, but also spread FIRST to the surrounding communities, ultimately leading to the creation of three other local Caterpillar teams. This drive for outreach remains strong, and Jim organizes dozens of presentations each year at schools and community events. Through a partnership with the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, our robotics team demonstrates before diverse crowds of several thousand students. At these events, Jim offers each student the opportunity to work with our team, and, if the student feels he or she is too young or lives too far away to work with us regularly, Jim finds FIRST Tech Challenge and FIRST Robotics Competition teams in their area for them to join.
          	<br /><br />
For one Titan alumnus, this opportunity was just what he needed to jumpstart a career in engineering: “I went to a school which did not offer a robotics team. When I emailed Jim about joining the team, he quickly welcomed me to the team and introduced me to its members. Jim allowed me to immediately feel at home working at a new school among strangers.”
<br /><br />
Jim’s dedication to science and technology is evident in all that he does. As the ‘Innovation and Entrepreneurship Director’ at a technologically inclined school, Jim is in the perfect position to help students bring their STEM ideas to fruition. In fact, his TALENT Entrepreneurship Club was created for this express purpose and serves to connect young inventors with organizations such as Tellabs, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce Foundation, and Prism Capital Corporation. With Jim’s careful suggestions, a slew of technology extracurriculars have arisen: Advanced Computing Association, Radio Club, One Laptop Per Child, and, of course, our FIRST Robotics team 2022.
<br /><br />
The true beauty of Jim’s leadership is his total belief in the future. To Jim, FRC is not a competition, a game to win or lose. Rather, it is a significant investment in tomorrow, and Jim handles it accordingly. He does not try to become the commander of our team but instead encourages us to step forward as leaders and innovators. Jim supplies us with a fertile environment for collaboration and discovery by inviting Caterpillar engineers and IMSA alumni to give seminars. He developed a web platform to connect the team, allowing active involvement of students from two high schools, four middle schools, and countless universities. He serves as a quiet voice of reason, guiding us towards effective communication and creative problem solving. Jim’s vivid excitement about technology and his treatment of students as capable, imaginative equals has left an indelible mark on both our team and the western suburbs.
