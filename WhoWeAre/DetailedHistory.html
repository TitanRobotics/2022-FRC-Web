          	Rachel walker—iit<br />
We were the first team for CAT up in this area<br />
First year—just pretty much us, don’t think we had a cat engineer working for us the first year (we paid entry fee for Midwest and cat called us and asked why we paid)<br />
The next year, we got wind that these people fcrom cat were movng from Peoria, and the ppl were mark Anderson and Andrea.<br /> 
They came and said, we want to really pursue up in this area, we did stuff with teams in Peoria but not here.<br>
We would like u to have cat engineers. And we’d like you to help us contact other teams<br>
-why don’t we help mentor you with Oswego teams? (this is either second year (probs) or third yr)<br>
-we started doing engineering 101<br>
	-our engineers will teach once a week different things that are fundamental for knowing for robotics.<br>
	-we went to Oswego for those. They had Oswego kids that they recruited, and they’d teach some topic, and we’d do this every week.<br>
	-we started doing flapjack robots together.<br>
	-decided to form mixed teams. Created vex robots for flapjack that year with combined teams.<br>
-all the kids knew each other pretty well<br>
	-the next year, we did the same thing and added Batavia.<br>
	-now, 3 schools to do engineering 101<br>
		-classes 2in diff places<br>
	-and next yr after that too<br>
	-didn’t mix preseason teams together (too hard to build robot with some students at 1 school and some at the other)<br>
-what happened was, the cat engineers started owning the Oswego team<br>
	-didn’t have enough kids to do anything (no programmers)<br>
	-cat engineers programmed the robots (probably Mark that did it)<br>
	-got real involved with that (the cat engineers did)<br>
	-at the same time, we had few ppl working with IMSA at all (feeling was, we were doing ok on own, so other teams got all the attention).<br>
-after that, we decided engineering 101 classes are really boring<br>
	-they talk down to us, waste of our time<br>
-we decided to do our own eng 101 classes<br>
	-2010, they did @ IMSA<br>
<br>
-outreach to students not @ IMSA<br>
	-students (10+) and teacher<br>
		-invite others to join our team<br>
		-trying to start west aurora start (they tried to start it before, but we’re trying to start it again)<br>
	-ppl recognize us for STEM, and now they call us to come do STEM events<br>
		-recognize both our robotics team and IMSA<br>
		-do stuff at our school too (cyberquiz)<br>
		-we get a lot out of it (sophomores are part of things)<br>
	-preview days<br>
RAHC<br>
	-competition<br>
	-future for next year—creating a comfort/entertainment bots for kids that are ___<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
*start with definition for chairman’s award<br>
	-this is what we believe to be the purpose of FIRST/purpose of this award<br>
	-and this is how we went about fulfilling that.<br>
IMSA<br>
	-3 yr residential high school for students that are academically talented and interested in math and science<br>
[bridge into talking about robotics]<br>
-our school is already more stem-oriented than most traditional high schools<br>
-6 yrs ago, 3 students decided to realize that although we have a lot of interest in extracurriculars tailored for specific interests in math or SCIENCE,<br>
it’s very difficult to find something that combines both of them.<br>
-and so they approached our mentor with the idea of a robotics team and got an official status as a club,<br>
 but they still needed to find funding, so  they reached out to caterpillar [insert brief synopsis of cat story (Meow Meow)]<br>
-we ran classes for first Oswego team, and paired up with them, and worked on preseason robots with them, ran mixed teams w/ their students and our students<br>
<br>
**2 main goals of FIRST<br>
-excellent engineers<br>
	-place in regional/championship competition<br>
-chairman’s fills the spot for teams who they don’t necessarily build the best engineers, but the broadest base of engineers—they have longevity for a team, <br>
so they go out there, and not everybody might necessarily be interested in FIRST, but they will get kids interested in STEM, and in particular, engineering. <br>
So that’s what this award is for.<br>
<br>
-intro/definition<br>
-brief history of robotics team (<br>
	-our team is constantly looking to create new opportunities for other students in the FIRST organization<br>
	-when we first started out—first cat team in area<br>
	-integral in starting both Oswego/Batavia teams<br>
		-we are 3 cat sponsored teams<br>
		-preseason for Oswego, we ran mixed teams, so that we had our students act as mentors to rookie Oswego students<br>
		-built preseason robots using that method (vex), created bond with other teams<br>
		-setup eng 101 classes<br>
		-etc<br>
-[something about how we continue to do this with west aurora]<br>
	-kids on our team from multiple different high schools<br>
		-we realize that we’re very fortunate to have robotics team, <br>
		and we don’t want other students who may not have the interest levels in their school or the finances to have a robotics team to be robbed of the opportunity.<br>
		-we want to make sure everyone in the community has the opportunity to experience what we have experienced as a robotics team.<br>
	-kids not in west aurora r from stem events we visit<br>
		-preview days<br>
			-give ppl jim’s #, anyone interested in team, and coolhub, so they can come to any of our meetings<br>
		-STEM events<br>
			-every STEM fest for the surrounding middle schools (Naperville)<br>
-RAHC<br>
	-[give them RAHC flyers ]<br>
	-last year, our principal diagnosed with ALS<br>
	-we decided to create competition<br>
		-wanted to find best way to help him<br>
		-expanded this into helping other ppl w/ disabilities<br>
		-inspired by him to create something else<br>
	-this year, the competition was for ppl w/ restricted upper body movement<br>
		-[talk about feeding]<br>
	-[talk about how arm ended up/process]<br>
		-[show them arm and tell them how it’s controlled]<br>
-ending<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We'll make this better, soon.<br>
Probably.
