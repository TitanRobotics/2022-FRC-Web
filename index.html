            <h3>Team Name IMSA Robotics Specialists (IRS) 2022</h3>
            
            <h3>Corporate/University Sponsors Caterpillar, Inc.</h3>
            Briefly describe the impact of the FIRST program on team participants with special emphasis on the 2>008/2009 year and the preceding two years<br />
            
            <h3>Quotations</h3>
            Control Engineering Online Magazine quoted many of our team members in an article about FIRST Robotics.<br />
            The following quotations, taken directly from the article, describe the impact that FIRST has had on individual team members:<br />
            <br />
            “Playing games is hard. FIRST Robotics is not just some event where some students are told to build a robot to play some game in six weeks. It is when students are challenged to do things that they never would have thought of doing before and encouraged to reach out in their community and ask people of various professions to work with them and dared to create something through their hard work that they are truly proud of. And what results from this? Strong bonds are made with people. Memories are formed. Students realize the importance of teamwork, hard work, and gracious professionalism in the real world. In other words, we have a ton of fun!”<br />
            – Monica Kozbial class of 2011<br />
            <br />
            “Robotics is important. Gracious professionalism is the key to life. Agreeing on a robot design is harder than building the actual robot.”<br />
            – Aryssa Burton class of 2010<br />
            <br />
            “FIRST is a wonderful experience for young students to learn first-hand about being an engineer. By getting involved, students are choosing to participate in a worldwide organization that supports more than just building robots; it supports strengthening the relationship between real engineer mentors in order to prepare the world’s next engineers.”<br />
            – Caitlin Bunt class of 2009<br />
            <br />
            “The best part of FRC is the people. They make everyone feel safe and respected. It also builds self-confident and creative individuals.”<br />
            – Cameron Breedlove class of 2009<br />
            <br />
            “FIRST is unique in its field. It taps our creativity into something that will matter.”<br />
            – Alina Kononov class of 2010<br />
            <br />
            “The FIRST robotics program has pioneered creativity in technology at IMSA.”<br />
            – Jonathan Munoz class of 2011<br />
            <br />
            “FIRST has shown me what engineering is – much more than you could ever learn on paper.”<br />
            – Renny O’Connor class of 2009<br />
            <br />
            Examples of role model characteristics for other teams to emulate<br />
            
            <h3>Role Models</h3>
            We expect role model US FIRST Teams to:<br />
            Help each other out (documentation, tools, etc.)<br />
            Complement each other and learn through other robots (learning = goal)<br />
            Display gracious professionalism (respecting team space, environments, and attitudes)<br />
            <br />
            Describe the impact of the FIRST program on your team and community with special emphasis on the 2008/2009 year and the preceding two years (500 characters allowed, including spaces and punctuation)<br />
            <br />
            Bonding experience (spend time learning and working together)<br />
            <br />
            “FIRST breaks down the walls of the classroom and expresses students (us) to the real world; the world where deadlines loom and problems arise that require addressing. Throughout the season the team must evolve and adapt.”<br />
            – A.J. Kalkowski class of 2011<br />
            <br />
            “FIRST is about more than robots. It’s about uniting a group of individuals who would have been unable to accomplish the goal, and showing them that math and science and teamwork have real value in this world.”<br />
            – Scott Page class of 2009<br />
            <br />
            “FIRST has, as one of its stated goals, the transformation of our society into one which values science and technology. I think it’s working. It has transformed my friends into capable and confident engineers. The kids in FIRST now are the ones who you are going to see building the future, one bolt at a time.”<br />
            – Adam Novak IMSA ’08 FRC #2022 Alumnus<br />
            <br />
            Team’s innovative methods to spread the FIRST message<br />
            <br />
            <h3>Innovative Methods</h3>
            Team IRS took on the following projects in 2008 and 2009 to spread the FIRST message.<br />
            <br />
            Display case<br />
            A display case currently displays information about FIRST and our team endeavors. This display case is outside our auditorium as well as our robotics room. The hallway is well-lit and used often.<br />
            <br />
            Student and Staff Emails<br />
            Emails have periodically been sent to staff and students through our school email system. (Our school has a 1:1 student computing program with campus-wide wireless, making email the most efficient method of communication).<br />
            <br />
            IMSA Preview days<br />
            Many potential IMSA students (freshman aged and younger) visit the academy with their families from various locations throughout Illinois. We have displayed past year’s robots by having them perform various tasks and explained the competition to these visitors.<br />
            Events in the Cafeteria<br />
            <br />
            Club Fair Booth<br />
            We set up a booth at our school’s annual Club Fair. Our 2008 Overdrive robot was displayed at a nearby location picking up the large ball and maneuvering it around obstacles. Buttons and flyers were handed out to our classmates and teachers.<br />
            <br />
            Alumni Event<br />
            We set up a booth at our school’s first annual Alumni Homecoming Day, where alumni were welcomed back to campus. Other organizations set up booths, but we were the only student organization at the day’s event. The alumni were very supportive of our team and we have created an alumni emailing list.<br />
            Media Support<br />
            We contacted local news sources last year (2008) and have been contacting various media sources throughout the 2009 season in coordination with IMSA’s Coordinator of Public Information. Control Engineering online magazine has been in communication with our team and produced their first article on our team, “2009 FIRST Robotics Competition: What some young robot designers are thinking”. We are looking forward to their follow-up story on our team after competition.
            Describe the strength of your partnership with special emphasis on the 2008/2009 year and the preceding two years (500 characters allowed, including spaces and punctuation)<br />
            <br />
            We have maintained the same contacts with our sponsor Caterpillar. These include a full time Coach recently retired from Caterpillar, and an IMSA alumni. Additionally, we are still in contact with Oswego Robotics and the newest team in our local area, Batavia Robotics. We provided spare parts to assist Batavia Robotics when shipments failed to arrive on time, and practiced with both teams at a Caterpillar built field. Our team is very close with the team members from Oswego and Batavia, having gone to dinners and socials with these teams and living within several miles of these high schools.<br />
            <br />
            Team’s communication methods and results (500 characters allowed, including spaces and punctuation).<br />
            <br />
            This year marks a new leadership program that was developed by last year’s core student team. We created a student board comprised of secretary, treasurer, project manager, public relations, and four system integrators (drive base, manipulator, electronics, and programming). We have also broken the team down into committees based on these board positions. This has helped with communicating the concerns of the team and robot and helped our team to cover all aspects of the robot. The strengths of all members are highlighted throughout our new leadership system and helps to break up work load so that all members have a fair chance of being part of Team IRS.<br />
            <br />
            Other matters of interest to the FIRST judges, if any (500 characters allowed, including spaces and punctuation).<br />
            <br />
            This year we emphasized precise design and Computer aided prototyping using Autodesk products. Thanks to our use of these tools we cut total time physically working on the robot by an additional 25% when compared to last years effort.<br />
            We also focused on student recruitment, and have doubled the number of students on our team (2008 = 14 members and 2 mentors , 2009 = 27 members and 4 mentors). We have many more girls and underclassmen on our team than we did in the past two years and have included 4 girls and 3 underclassmen on our student board.<br />
            
            <h3>Essay</h3>
            As a member of the IMSA Robotics Specialists, I understand the importance of getting others involved in engineering. Combining my interest with others within the team, I assisted in a research project in 2008 that yielded results crucial to our performance and team lay out this year (2009). Apart from discoveries into the efficiencies and weaknesses of typical FIRST drive bases, the team of four involved in the program ran into many issues typical to our FIRST robotics team in our rookie year. By admitting that communications were breaking down within even our small student group, we began to discus ideas to prevent such challenges in future years. With the primary objective of producing a leadership program for our FIRST team that would allow it to continue and prosper after the charter team members had graduated, our discussions quickly began debates over efficient structures. The structures discussed had nothing to do with aluminum, or sensor placement- they all involved communication, teaching, mentor involvement, and growth. Through our efforts the board quickly grew from the original four research students, to eight. These students endured many hours of self induced Board meetings with the hope of a smoother season for new members. The discussions established a mission statement, list of goals, and etiquette guide lines that encompassed student to student and mentor to student communications. With an interest in preserving a for students by student atmosphere, strict limits were placed on mentor involvement to avoid becoming a for mentors by students team. However our mentor guide lines explicitly stated an interest in more mentor assistance than in previous years. Armed with a cohesive ideal of what we wanted our team to look like, we began the 2009 preseason with a heavy interest in attracting and maintaining new members. To maintain members we created mini build projects that allowed student to get a grasp of the engineering process that would be vital during the upcoming season. As a result of these mini builds the majority of the team was fully versed in tool use prior to the release of the 2009 game. This aided in safety and increased our efficiency from the previous year as we did not have to spend time training individuals how to be safe. Our other capstone program that was executed on this year is known as engineering 101. This program was suggested by team IRS and designed by Caterpillar the previous year. As a result of this program our team members met members of other local teams Batavia, and Oswego. Through this interaction they were able to branch out side of IMSA socially. This was extremely important to our residential school, and to my knowledge no Robotics team members left IMSA- possibly due to the social connections they were able to form. While at engineering 101 students learned basic skills such as the physics of drive train, and programming structure. Armed with these programs to maintain membership, our board members recognized a short fall in the ability's of our Intersession students in 2008. As a result of last years open application to a 1 week long robotics learning experience at the beginning of the season, we had noticed that people that had never participated were filling spaced that should have been dedicated to more interested individuals. Establishing an attendance program based off of participation in engineering 101 and the mini builds, we were able to redefine our club into a team. In this way, IRS is recognized by IMSA as a club in the pre and post seasons, and an interscholastic program on the same level as Volleyball and Football, during the build and competition season. This allowed us to monitor grades of robotics students, helping to prevent the previous robotics induced fail-outs of our charter year.<br />
            <br />
            I am happy to mention the result of our restructuring and FIRST program at IMSA, include plans to present at Scitec(Not-for-profit science museum) in our post season 2009. Additionally, all of our participating seniors have applied to and been accepted to engineering and business majors. The efforts of the Robotics student base have been recognized by the IMSA administration, resulting in IMSA redefining its Mission statement to include STEM learning. Due to this, Robotics is now officially classified as part of IMSA's STEM initiative while maintaining its roots in Student control.<br />
            <br />
            I thank the initiative of previous students for allowing me to inherit and share our amazing team with others interested in engineering. As a result of my participation in FIRST robotics with team IRS over the past three years I have learned many skills. I am now confident in my ability to present to large groups of people thanks to our extensive touring in the 2008 post season. I have become fluent in the use of tools needed to work with aluminum. Progressed from a building process of cut twice, measure...may be- to a knowledge that design must take first priority followed by precise measurement and clean safe cutting techniques. This includes the production of parts designed in CAD with our new CNC machine. I have also learned how to lead both leaders, and followers and how to effectively communicate and listen to ideas. I have discovered the importance of universal parts, and never giving up. I owe the FIRST program, and my extensive involvement in team 2022 for the connections I have established while participating. They have lead me to extensive conversations with the founder of YouTube, Steve Chen about entrepreneurship, have assisted me in securing jobs, and been crucial additions to my collage applications.<br />
            My experiences are not atypical of our core membership, and as new individuals express interest, our core continues to grow.<br />
            <br />
            I enjoyed every moment with the team, and hope that my efforts and those of the rest of the Board will allow Team 2022 IRS to flourish for many years after my graduation this year.<br />
